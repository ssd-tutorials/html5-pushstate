	<p>They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you've made it.<br />Oh, my! Do you?</p>
	<p>A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated.<br />Hey now, every time I lose attitude.</p>
	<p>You took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated.<br />
	Oh, my! Do you?<br />
	Now put away your welcome soon you'll find you've overstayed it.<br />
	Hey now, every time I lose attitude.</p>
	<p>So divine hell of an elevator all the while my fortune faded.<br />
	Never mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune faded.</p>
	<p>The medicated state of mind you'll find is overrated.<br />Oh, My! Do you?<br />
	You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it. Hey now, every time I lose attitude.</p>
	<p>So divine hell of an elevator all the while my fortune faded.<br />
	Never mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune faded.</p>
	<p>Come on God do I seem bulletproof?</p>
	<p>So divine hell of an elevator all the while my fortune faded.<br />
	Never mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune faded.</p>
	<p>So divine hell of an elevator all the while my fortune faded.<br />
	Never mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune faded.</p>
