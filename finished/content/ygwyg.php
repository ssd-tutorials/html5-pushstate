	<h1>You Get What You Give</h1>
	<p>Wake up kids we've got the dreamers disease - age 14 we got you down on your knees. So polite, you're busy still saying please.</p>
	<p>Fri - enemies, who when you're down ain't your friend, every night we smash their Mercedes - Benz. First we run and then we laugh till we cry.</p>
	<p>But when the night is falling and you cannot find the light, if you feel your dream is dying hold tight - you've got the music in you.</p>
	<p>Don't let go, you've got the music in you, one dance left this world is gonna pull through. Don't give up, you've got a reason to live.</p>
	<p>Can't forget you only get what you give four am we ran a miracle mile, were flat broke but hey we do it in style the bad rich god's flying in for your trial.</p>
	<p>This whole damn world can fall apart you'll be ok follow your heart. You're in harms way I'm right behind now say you're mine.</p>
	<p>Fly high, what's real can't die - you only get what you give just don't be afraid to leave.</p>
	<p>Health insurance rip off lying, FDA big bankers buying. Fake computer crashes dining, cloning while they're multiplying.</p>
	<p>Fashion mag shoots with the aid of 8 dust brothers Beck, Hanson, Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson - you're all fakes, run to your mansions - come around we'll kick your ass in!</p>
	<p>Don't let go, one dance left this world is gonna pull through. Don't give up - you've got a reason to live, can't forget we only get what we give.</p>
